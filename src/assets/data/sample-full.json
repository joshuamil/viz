should be static.\r\n\r\nTechnical Notes\r\n# UI\r\n## Populate dates from Step 1\r\n## Clicking on a date scrolls the grid so that the selected date appears within the first week\r\n## Based on selected items in the work order, provide a list of departments to be displayed in the grid\r\n## Based on selected locations in the work order, provide a list of locations to be displayed in the grid\r\n## Highlight cells (in light blue) for events that have been selected in the work order\r\n## Limit region filter to regions selected in work order\r\n## When modeling, consider splitting backend data (essentially capacities) for date range, and work order data on the front-end\r\n## Graph has 2 numbers\r\n### Average of the total capacity for all locations (rows) in the grid — currently done in the front-end\r\n### Average number of events per location — Note: number of events per location is not displayed in the location rows\r\n## Validation — workforce capacity limits must be respected\r\n# Backend\r\n## Implement endpoint that returns currently scheduled aggregated data for\r\n### these locations, departments, dates and item attributes\r\n### consider loading 2 weeks ahead of intended view, also\r\n## add Location total capacity, food, and non-food, and department attributes\r\n## (FUTURE WORK) Modify User account, for scheduler’s, a region of responsibility is to be included\r\n# Follow-up Discussion Topics\r\n## as the user considers moving event(s) from one date to another, we probably should update the counts in the UI by performing arithmetic on the
